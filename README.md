# Smart-Monitoring-System-For-Farming
Control system which can monitor and improve the conditions of temperature, humidity and light intensity for a given particular plant

The system is designed for small and private farming purposes which is held under unnatural light and temperature resources. 
It measures the temperature, light intensity and humidity of the interested plants, and gives warning in case that non-optimal conditions are detected for them.
By doing this, the system aims at providing the perfect artificial conditions for those plants to raise.
